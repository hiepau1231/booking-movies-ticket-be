  - Image upload with preview
  - Status management with Vietnamese indicators
  - Add/edit/delete UI
  - Routing and sidebar link

  - Vietnamese translations
- Admin dashboard charts (`Dashboard.tsx`) have been visually enhanced with improved styling, gradients, and tooltip consistency.
- The admin sidebar (`Layout.tsx`) has been stylistically harmonized with the dashboard.
- Theater Management page (`TheaterManagement.tsx`) for admin panel has a complete UI with mocked CRUD operations, Formik/Yup validation, and styling aligned with the dashboard. Type definitions in `theater.ts` are established. TypeScript errors related to image URL handling were resolved.
- Initial components (`BookingPage.tsx`, `BookingForm.tsx`) and routing for the user-facing booking page are in place. `BookingForm.tsx` includes a multi-step stepper structure, but the content for each step (Showtime, Seats, Food, Payment) is currently placeholder and requires full implementation.
- Recent linter errors in `Dashboard.tsx` (Recharts props) and `routes.tsx` (missing `Register` component, `MovieForm` props) have been addressed. The `Register.tsx` file has been created, and `MovieForm` uses temporary placeholder props.

## Known Issues
- Mock data used in dashboard and management interfaces
- Some Vietnamese translations may need refinement
- API integration needed for all management interfaces
- Performance optimization needed for large datasets in reports
- Mobile responsiveness improvements needed for charts
- Date range selection UX needs enhancement
- Need to implement data caching for reports
- Optimize database queries for large datasets
- Add more chart types and visualization options
- Enhance export functionality with more formats
- Add print functionality for reports
- Booking service layer needs implementation
- Payment integration pending
- Booking validation rules needed
- Error states needed for offline mode
- Implement proper error states for offline mode
- `MovieForm` component invocations in `admin-interface/src/routes.tsx` use placeholder `null` props for `movie` and empty functions for `onSave`/`onCancel`; these need to be replaced with actual data fetching logic (for edit mode) and functional callbacks.
- The user-facing `BookingForm.tsx` contains placeholder content for its steps (Showtime Selection, Seat Selection, Food & Drinks, Confirm & Pay). Each step requires full UI implementation, API integration, and state management.
- The linter might show a temporary error for the `admin-interface/src/pages/auth/Register.tsx` import in `admin-interface/src/routes.tsx` if it hasn't fully re-indexed after the file creation (the file does exist and the error should resolve).

## Next Steps

4. Admin Panel Development:
   - Add mock data for UI preview
   - Enhance error handling for offline mode
   - Add loading states for data-dependent components
5. New Modules:
   - Complete Cinema (Theater) management module
   - Complete Branch management module (backend integration, enhancements)
   - Complete Invoice (Bill) management module (backend integration, enhancements)
